For some reason the nerd in me really likes teletype effects. Maybe it that old school factor that I like.

The other day I came across this [rather nice usage](https://wsend.net/) of the teletype effect done in JavaScript. Checking out the source it seemed quite simple, so I looked for alternative jQuery plugins that did the same thing.

I came across a [post by Yoshi on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13325547/119624), which I transposed into a Bootstrap 3 live example on jsFiddle. You can play around with it below.
