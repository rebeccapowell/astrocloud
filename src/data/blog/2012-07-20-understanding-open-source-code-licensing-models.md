> I’m writing about this topic because I recently saw some guys using my code in their projects without keeping the copyright notice (I really don’t want to blame anybody in this article).

> The fact that they used my code was not really the problem, I love inspiring other people to do awesome stuff based on some of my concepts and thoughts and I’m happy when I could help you with my code. So everybody is free to use my code, but now the important part, under the given license terms.
