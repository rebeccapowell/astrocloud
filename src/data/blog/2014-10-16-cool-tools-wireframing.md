Axure RP gives you the wireframing, prototyping and documentation tools needed to make informed design choices, persuade any skeptics, and document your design... and maybe win a few fans along the way. Choose the Standard edition for prototyping or go Pro to add documentation and collaboration features.

Balsamiq Mockups is a rapid wireframing tool that helps you work faster and smarter. It reproduces the experience of sketching on a whiteboard, but using a computer.

Making mockups is fast. You'll generate more ideas, so you can throw out the bad ones and discover the best solutions.
