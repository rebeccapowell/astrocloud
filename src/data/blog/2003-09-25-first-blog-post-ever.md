I've just created this new blog based on code provided by Johan Danforth, see [http://www.codeproject.com/soap/weblog.asp](http://www.codeproject.com/soap/weblog.asp) for more details.

If you haven't got access to a SQL server, but you do have the .NET framework installed on your hosting platform then try it out. It's completely XML based and has a Windows based client that happily sits in your system tray all day, for easy access to publish your thoughts.....brilliant!
