AstroPaper v5 is here, bringing full support for Astro v5 and a host of improvements! This guide will help you upgrade your AstroPaper blog from v4 to v5, summarize the key changes, and highlight new features.

## Why Upgrade to AstroPaper v5?

- **Astro v5 Support:** Enjoy the latest performance, DX, and ecosystem improvements from Astro v5.
- **Modernized Codebase:** Cleaner, more maintainable code with updated dependencies and best practices.
- **Improved Image Handling:** New responsive image features and better defaults for `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components.
- **Enhanced Markdown & Content:** Updated content collections, improved slug handling, and more robust blog post management.
- **UI/UX Improvements:** New and improved components, better accessibility, and a more polished design.

## Key Changes in v5

### 1. Astro v5 Compatibility
- The codebase and dependencies are now fully compatible with Astro v5.
- Removed deprecated or obsolete config flags (e.g., `experimental: { svg: true }`).
- Updated integrations and plugins for v5 support.

### 2. Image & Asset Handling
- New `experimentalLayout: "constrained"` and `responsiveImages: true` for better image performance.
- Improved asset organization and new images/icons added.

### 3. Content & Slug Management
- Continued use of Astro's built-in `slug` for blog posts (introduced in v4, now standard).
- More robust handling of content collections and release notes.

### 4. Component & Layout Updates
- Refactored and modernized components (e.g., `BackButton.astro`, `BackToTopButton.astro`).
- New and improved icons, layouts, and utility functions.
- Deprecated or removed old React-based components in favor of Astro components.

### 5. Dependency & Config Updates
- Updated `package.json`, lockfiles, and Node.js version for compatibility.
- Cleaned up and modernized `astro.config.ts` and other config files.

## Migration Steps

1. **Backup Your Project:** Always create a backup branch before upgrading.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure your `package.json` and lockfiles are updated for Astro v5.
3. **Merge or Rebase:** Pull the latest changes from the official AstroPaper repo and resolve any conflicts, especially in config and component files.
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Run your site locally, check for build errors, and verify all custom content and design are preserved.
5. **Review Breaking Changes:** Pay special attention to removed experimental flags, icon import paths, and any deleted/renamed files.
6. **Push and Deploy:** Once everything works, push your changes and redeploy your site.

## Notable Breaking Changes
- The `experimental: { svg: true }` flag is no longer needed and should be removed.
- Some components have been renamed, removed, or refactored (e.g., React `.tsx` components replaced with `.astro`).
- Icon import paths may have changed; update as needed.
- Some blog post files may have moved or been renamed (e.g., release notes).

## Useful Git Commands for Upgrading

git fetch upstream
```

### 2. Create a backup branch before merging
```powershell
git checkout -b pre-merge-backup
```

### 3. Create a new branch for the merge
```powershell
git checkout -b merge-astro-paper
```

### 4. Merge upstream changes
```powershell
git merge upstream/main
```

### 5. See which files have conflicts
```powershell
git status
```

### 6. Mark resolved files as resolved

git add <filename>
```

### 7. For deleted files you want to keep deleted
```powershell
git rm <filename>
```

### 8. For files you want to keep their version (theirs)
```powershell
git checkout --theirs <filename>
git add <filename>
```

### 9. For files you want to keep your version (ours)
```powershell
git checkout --ours <filename>
git add <filename>
```

### 10. Commit the merge after resolving all conflicts

```

### 11. Push your merge branch
