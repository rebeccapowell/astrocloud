## My Background
As a seasoned software engineer with over 25 years of experience in Microsoft platform development, I have had the privilege of witnessing the evolution of .NET since its inception. My experience has taught me the value of staying on the cutting edge of technological advancements, and I have made a point to remain informed and engaged in the industry.

I also have extensive experience working on electronic integration projects with SOAP and REST. Over the years, I have gained a deep understanding of the intricacies and nuances involved in developing and implementing these technologies. Whether it’s designing and developing custom APIs or integrating with existing systems, I have a proven track record of success in delivering seamless, efficient, and secure electronic integrations.

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to function as an experienced Agile team member. I understand the importance of clear communication and collaboration, and I have honed my skills to be able to navigate even the most complex development projects with ease. In addition, I am highly organized and can quickly adapt to changing requirements, ensuring that all deadlines are met with accuracy and efficiency.

My broad knowledge of internet technology allows me to deep dive into specialist subjects with ease, making me a valuable asset to any project. From web development to cloud computing and beyond, I have the expertise and insight necessary to deliver top-quality results.

Ultimately, I am passionate about what I do and I strive to approach every project with a can-do attitude. I believe that by working together and utilizing the latest technological innovations, we can create transformative solutions that help businesses thrive in the digital age.

My core skills are ASP.NET Core / Framework (Razor, MVC and Webforms) for both cloud and on-premise. Whilst I have many years of experience in DevOps for on-premise using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy, I now focus on building code using Cake and .Nuke, and build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps, and Github actions. I also have experience of local Docker development and Infrastructure as Code in the form of Pulumi.

I understand the various models, patterns and architectures and their benefits and pitfalls. I have a long involvement in integrating companies into the Royal & Sun Alliance SCMT supply chain, which I’ve been involved in for over 15 years. I’m happy working in Microsoft SQL Server, but also have some experience of working with Postgres and MySQL. On the NoSql side, MongoDb.

I’ve developed a number of productionized applications that utilize the popular CQRS patterns and eventing using RabbitMq and MassTransit as well as NServiceBus and MSMQ. I was an early adopter of ServiceStack and have a StackOverflow profile that puts me in the top 3%.

TLDR – I build resilient event driven cloud based architectures using a modern and performant technology stack.
