This is my personal space on the internet. I've been around tech development, especially Microsoft tech development since the mid-ninties. I've seen the ecosystem grow and mature over that time.

I worked on lots of different projects after spending 20 years contracting. I now work for a green energy company based in Hamburg, managing two technical development teams focused on the B2B energy commodities market.

The views expressed are my own personal opinions.

## My Background
With over 25 years of experience in Microsoft platform development, I've had the opportunity to witness the evolution of .NET since its inception. Staying updated with technological advancements has always been a priority for me, and I strive to remain informed and engaged in the industry.

I have extensive experience working on electronic integration projects with SOAP and REST. Over the years, I've developed a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in developing and implementing these technologies. Whether it’s designing and developing custom APIs or integrating with existing systems, I have a proven track record of delivering seamless, efficient, and secure electronic integrations.

One of my strengths is my ability to function effectively as an Agile team member. I understand the importance of clear communication and collaboration, and I have honed my skills to navigate even the most complex development projects. Additionally, I am highly organized and can quickly adapt to changing requirements, ensuring that all deadlines are met with accuracy and efficiency.

My broad knowledge of internet technology allows me to dive into specialist subjects with ease, making me a valuable asset to any project. From web development to cloud computing and beyond, I have the expertise and insight necessary to deliver top-quality results.

Ultimately, I am passionate about what I do and strive to approach every project with a positive attitude. I believe that by working together and utilizing the latest technological innovations, we can create transformative solutions that help businesses thrive in the digital age.

Over the past few years, I have transitioned into managing software development teams specializing in Microsoft Dynamics solutions, seamlessly integrated with Azure infrastructure (AKS) and frontend applications built with React and GraphQL. My primary focus is on guiding teams to successful project delivery, mentoring team members, fostering strong leadership, and creating a supportive and inclusive work environment.

I am adept at collaborating with both product and business teams in English and German, and I have extensive experience working in agile environments, whether following Scrum, Kanban, or Scrumban methodologies. Additionally, I hold a certified qualification in Kanban System Design and have completed multiple leadership training programs.

## My Experience
For the last twenty years, I have worked for IT solutions providers, primarily in the insurance, banking and finance sectors.

Over the years, I have worked with clients ranging from large well-known corporations to small independent companies and startups.

My core skills are ASP.NET Core / Framework (Razor, MVC and Webforms) for both cloud and on-premise. Whilst I have many years of experience in DevOps for on-premise using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy, I now focus on building code using Cake and .Nuke, and build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps, and Github actions. I also have experience of local Docker development and Infrastructure as Code in the form of Pulumi.

I understand the various models, patterns and architectures and their benefits and pitfalls. I have a long involvement in integrating companies into the Royal & Sun Alliance SCMT supply chain, which I’ve been involved in for over 15 years. I’m happy working in Microsoft SQL Server, but also have some experience of working with Postgres and MySQL. On the NoSql side, MongoDb.

I’ve developed a number of productionized applications that utilize the popular CQRS patterns and eventing using RabbitMq and MassTransit as well as NServiceBus and MSMQ. I was an early adopter of ServiceStack and have a StackOverflow profile that puts me in the top 3%.

TLDR – I build resilient event driven cloud based architectures using a modern and performant technology stack.

## Passion for Integration
In addition to my technical skills, I also bring a strong commitment to customer satisfaction to every project I work on. I believe that communication and collaboration are key to delivering successful software, and I work closely with my clients to ensure that their needs are met at every stage of the development process. Whether you’re looking for a one-off project or a long-term partner for your software development needs, I am ready to help.

## My Core Competencies
Whilst I have a general broad overview of internet technology, it is these three elements that I specialize in:

### REST APIs
Building APIs that other developers want to use is key to encouraging the use of your platform. Getting it wrong can cost you customers and sales. Developers trial your service before recommending it, so it’s worth getting it right!

### Azure Cloud Computing
Taking advantage of the cloud is key to modern software development for enterprise businesses. Cloud computing and especially serverless architectures allow your business to pay for what it needs and no more.

### Data Integrations
Connecting enterprise customers for data interchange is challenging to get right. From classic XML web services, to SOAP and WCF, I’ve connected various complex data workflows together using resilient and dependable interfaces.

**EDM Group & Restore Plc** - 2016-2022
